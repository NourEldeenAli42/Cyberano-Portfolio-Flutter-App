lib/
└── main.dart        # The entry point 
└── main_app.dart    # UI code

assets/
└── images/          # Store your profile picture here
pubspec.yaml         # Project configuration and assets
🛠️ Challenge for Students
Once you have the app running, try to make it your own:

Change the theme color: Find the Colors property in the Scaffold and pick your favorite color.

Update the info: Replace the placeholder name and bio with your own details.

Add a new Card: Add a third Card widget to display your GitHub username or personal website.
